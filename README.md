done.go
=======

This is a pet project to learn go and solve a small problem at the same time.

**done.go** provides:
* a cli client `done.go`
* an integration with slack to post every done to a channel near "real time"
* and a go library to consume the iDone this api
* 


**Disclaimer**
```
- This is not an offical package, iDoneThis brand is from guys at idonethis.com.
- The authentication for this is token based so this is not registered to use oauth. 
- When it gets bigger probably i will register it.
```
